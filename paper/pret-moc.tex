\maketitle \thispagestyle{empty}

\begin{abstract}
A good paper has a short, concise abstract. The abstract
states the field of the research, the purpose, and the findings (results).
\end{abstract}

From IEEE: your abstract should:

* Provide a concise summary of the research conducted, the conclusions reached, and the potential implications of those conclusions

* Be self-contained, without abbreviations, footnotes, references, or mathematical equations

* Include 3-5 keywords or phrases that describe the research to help readers find your article

* Consist of a single paragraph of 250 words or less

* Communicate clearly and concisely, with correct grammar and unambiguous terminology

\begin{IEEEkeywords}
real-time systems, time-predictable computer architecture.

\section{The PRET Actor Model}
\label{sec:actor}

Our modeling and execution environment consists of actors that contain
handlers. Handlers are executed atomically within an actor.
Handlers can be released be the arrival of messages on the input
port, an external event, an external callback, or by passage of time.

Actors contain input and output ports, which each containing just a single
buffer. Messages can be overwritten and are not consumed on a read.
Each message has a time stamp.

Within actors the logical time does not advance between an input message
and the production of an output message.

\section{Execution Platforms}

For the execution of the actors with repeatable timing we need time-predictable
execution platforms. The basis is a processor with time-predictable or repeatable
timing.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

\todo{Computer engineering is a constructive science. We build stuff and we measure.
Therefore, there shall always be an evaluation section.}

\subsection{Source Access}

\martin{I love doing papers with available source under an
open-source license. It gives credit and good karma.}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\todo{Rephrase what this paper is about and list the main contributions and results.}

\section{Notes}

Here collect of notes and ideas in bullet list for the development and writing process:

\begin{itemize}
\item Collect related work
\item Some more notes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Terminology}

\martin{We should start to find a terminology that we stick to (within this paper).}

Handlers can be released or fired. Released is more the RTS world, fired more the
actor world.

The data of ports can be called message or event (with data).
